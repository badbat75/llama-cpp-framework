description: What the coder has learned about implementing and running code safely. Use when changing production code.

Lessons only: the rules are in `AGENTS.md`.

- `pkill -f PATTERN` also matches the shell running it, and killed that shell. Use the task's own stop
  control, or a pattern that cannot match itself.
- When a test fails, check whether the test or the code is wrong before changing either.
- A screenshot that comes out blank proves nothing about a GUI. Check that it really shows the window.
