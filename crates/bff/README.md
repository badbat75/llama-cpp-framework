# pai-bff and the web UI

`pai-bff` (package and binary `pai-bff`, over `pai-core`) is the backend-for-frontend: one local
HTTP service that serves the web UI built from `fe/` and the API it calls. Today it answers the
framework version and serves a page that shows it (`PLAN.md` step 10).

**It runs as a service on Linux and Windows, never on macOS.** `xtask build` compiles it into
`build/<os>/cargo-target/release/`; the packaging is in
[docs/build-packaging.md](../../docs/build-packaging.md).

- Linux: the package `private-ai-framework-bff` puts it in `/usr/libexec/private-ai/pai-bff` with
  `private-ai-bff.service` (`DynamicUser=yes`, hardened), enabled and started at install, restarted
  on upgrade, stopped on removal.
- Windows: the MSI installs the service `private-ai-bff` (`pai-bff.exe service`, automatic start,
  `NT SERVICE\private-ai-bff`, restarted after a failure). Its `Error:` line goes nowhere there: by
  the code, a bad `bff.ini` or a bind failure shows only in the service manager's state and exit code.
  Type-checked only, not yet run on Windows; the open checks are in the test plan of
  [installer/AGENTS.md](../../installer/AGENTS.md).

**It stops gracefully on SIGTERM (how systemd stops it) and Ctrl-C**: it stops accepting, lets the
open requests finish and exits 0. Under the Windows service manager the stop control does the same.

## Running it

**The address is `[Bff] Listen` in `bff.ini`, in the system config directory**
(`paths::system_config_dir`: `/etc/private-ai/bff.ini` on Linux and macOS,
`%ProgramData%\private-ai\config\bff.ini` on Windows, `<root>/system-config/bff.ini` under
`PRIVATE_AI_DATA_ROOT`). A missing file or key means `127.0.0.1:8590`.

```ini
[Bff]
Listen = 127.0.0.1:8590
```

- The value is an `ip:port` address: a host name (`localhost:8590`) is refused, nothing is resolved.
- Only a loopback address is accepted. LAN access waits for authentication (a later slice).

| Exit code | When |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | `pai-bff --version`, which prints `pai-bff <version>`; a stop by SIGTERM, Ctrl-C or the service manager |
| 2 | Any other argument, or anything after `service` (usage error) |
| 1 | A refused `Listen` value, an unreadable `bff.ini`, a bind failure or a serving error; `pai-bff service` outside the Windows service manager |

Every failure prints one `Error: ...` line on stderr naming the value, the file or the address. The
texts are the `bff-*` keys of `crates/core/strings/cli.toml`, found by the installed program in
`/usr/share/private-ai/strings/` on Linux (`paths::installed_share_candidates`). `pai-bff service`
hands the process to the Windows service dispatcher, which runs the same server. It serves on a current-thread tokio
runtime (axum).

| Route | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/version` | `{"version": "<framework version>"}` |
| `GET /` | The embedded `index.html` |
| `GET /assets/{*path}` | The embedded file at `assets/<path>` |

Other methods on these routes are 405, any other path 404. Only a path in the embedded table
matches, so `..` reaches nothing else. Content types go by extension: HTML, JavaScript
(`text/javascript`), CSS, anything else `application/octet-stream`.

Checked by hand on Linux from the debug build (2026-11-14): `--version` exits 0, an unknown argument
2, `0.0.0.0:8590` and `localhost:8590` exit 1; on `127.0.0.1` it answered `/api/version`, `/` as
`text/html`, 405 to a `POST` and 404 elsewhere.

## The web UI (`fe/`)

React + Vite in TypeScript, exact versions in `fe/package.json` and a committed
`package-lock.json`. One page (`fe/src/Version.tsx`) fetches `/api/version` and shows it, or a fixed
message on any failure, never the reply's body.

- **Text goes in `fe/src/strings/en_US.json`**, linked by key through `t(key, ...args)`
  (`fe/src/strings.ts`), with `pai-core`'s rules: `{N}` placeholders filled by position, a missing
  key shown as itself.
- **Tests**: Vitest and Testing Library in jsdom, `npm --prefix fe test` from the repo root
  (`npm --prefix fe ci` first when `fe/node_modules` is missing).
- **Built by `xtask build`**, embedded in the binary by `crates/bff/build.rs`: which directory it
  embeds and when it notices a new `fe/dist` are in
  ["The web UI and pai-bff"](../../docs/build-compiling.md#the-web-ui-and-pai-bff).

## Tests

`cargo test -p pai-bff` needs no node: without `fe/dist` it embeds the fixture
`crates/bff/fe-fixture/`. `tests/fe.rs` checks that the routes serve, byte for byte, the directory
the build embedded (`PAI_BFF_FE_DIR`); `tests/pai_bff_binary.rs` runs the binary with
`PRIVATE_AI_DATA_ROOT` on the child and an ephemeral port, SIGTERM and SIGINT included; `src/tests/deps_lint.rs` keeps the GUI
packages (Slint) out of its dependency tree. It is in the Windows GNU type check ("Commands" in
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#commands)); nothing of it has run on Windows.
